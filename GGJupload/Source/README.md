# PEOPLE OF EARTH! WE ARE THE SPACE JELLIES!

We've pillaged space of five earthlings to make a game of our adventures!

* Neko Pilzrcik-Tellez
* Oscar Wright
* Caitlin Moriarity

Together we've made them use their small disgusting tentacles to produce a game for the event known as Global Game Jam 2017, but it wasn't easy getting here.

You're job is to help us keep our spacecraft level as it sails the gravitational waves of space, because if you don't our space ship will implode into a black hole that will aim a deadly gamma ray burst that will destroy all life on your miserable planet.  Which from what we've heard would be a better alternative than four of your earth years of the man baby one with what we can only tell is a furry brain parasite on his head ruling one of your super powers countries. (Don't blame us. We voted for Kodos!)

This game is supposed to be simple. arrow keeps to keep up level. Don't make us wipe out!

MADE IS ST. LOUIS!
